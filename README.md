# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

## Introduction
This repository contains my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language.

## Structure
Each day's puzzles are solved in separate files for clarity and ease of understanding. The solutions are primarily written in Python, focusing on readability and efficient coding practices.

### Folder Structure
- `Day1/`: Solutions for Day 1
- `Day2/`: Solutions for Day 2
- `...`

## Contributions
While these solutions are primarily for my personal learning and exploration, suggestions and discussions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you have ideas on how to improve the solutions.
